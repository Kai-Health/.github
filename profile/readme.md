## About Kai Health organizational code repositories
Access to the Kai Health organizational code repositories is by invitation only.  Please contact your designated project lead for futher assistance.

<br />&nbsp;<br />

## Shared repository model
Following best practices for the [shared repository model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#shared-repository-model"), use of feature branches for changes is encouraged with pull requests to merge changes back into the `main` branch.  Most repositories enforce independent team member code reviews to approve changes prior to merging.
